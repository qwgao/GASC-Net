GASC-Net: A Geospatial Information-Assisted Network for Ship Classification
Ship classification in optical images has gained significant attention, encompassing coarse-grained, fine-grained, and instance-level classification based on the classification scope. Challenges such as cloud occlusion and insufficient lighting make using only images challenging for finer classification. This repository introduces geospatial information into ship classification, proposing a Geospatial Information-Assisted Ship Classification Network (GASC-Net).

The complete codebase and dataset will be publicly accessible upon the paper's acceptance.
